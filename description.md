## Features

### Identify Language

Detect the language of a text. Our platform currently distinguishes more than 30 languages.

### Topic Tagging

The objective of a topic tag is to describe the content of a text whether an email, commercial
contract, or a news article. A tag can be _cancel subscription_, _safe car_, or _terrible cook_.
Again, we can easily adjust tags to your domain and to your needs.

### Extract Entities

Search your texts for names of people, locations, products, dates, account numbers, etc.
We can adjust the detectors to your needs (e.g. taking into account your products) or even
identify a new type of entity whether it should be financial products or offending expressions.

### Detect Sentiment

Detect the emotions contained in the text. Was the author happy (_I loved it._),
neutral (_We went to London._) or unhappy (_The lunch was not good at all._) with their experience? You can detect sentiment of reviews, feedback or customer service inquiries.

## Models and customization

Please note that our standard models are optimized for three domains: news articles, hospitality customer care and transportation customer care. If used in other areas, the obtained results will not be as good as they could be. In order to ensure the best possible outcome for your domain, we will be happy to provide you with a customized model. We offer a basic customization for free. Contact us at info@geneea.com.
